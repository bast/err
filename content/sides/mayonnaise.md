## Ingredients

- 1 egg
- 1/2 Tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vinegar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 to 1 teaspoon mustard
- 1 cup oil (I often use half vegetable oil and half olive oil)


## Possible additions

I chop these up very coarsely and add them to the mix before blending. No
need to chop them up finely, the blender will take care of that.

- Garlic (to taste but no problem to use 3 cloves)
- Habanero pepper (to taste)


## Instructions

- Add the ingredients in the above order to a tall container that fits the
  hand blender.
- Let them sit for a minute or so to let the egg settle to the bottom. Oil will
  swim on top.
- Push the hand blender all the way to the bottom, hold it there, and start
  blending. Do not move the blender until you see the mayonnaise forming at the bottom. I
  typically count to 10 or 15 before I start moving the blender slowly up.
  Then I move blend up and down until everything is blended (15 seconds?).
- I mix it a bit more then with a spoon.
- Bottle it and store it in the fridge.
